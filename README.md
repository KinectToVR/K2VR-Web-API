# K2VR-Web-API
This repository holds a temporary static mock API, and will later contain the source of our REST API.

## Why this API?
This API allows us to easily update the "packages" for Amethyst Installer, serve version info to Amethyst itself, feed into CIs and more. And as a future goal, allow us to integrate anonymous opt-in analytics to help us understand what, why and how users use the app.

## License
The mock API is licensed under [CC-BY 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/).

Additional details on REST API source licensing will come later.
